# Contribute like a pro!

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Ziggy! To keep things running smoothly we ask you to follow a few guidelines when contributing.

## Open an Issue first.

If you have an idea for a feature, we'd prefer you open an issue before going to the trouble if writing code. We welcome your ideas, but we'd like to work with you to come up with solutions that work well for the project as a whole. We're usually pretty responsive, so it shouldn't take us long to figure out whether and how best to implement your idea.

## Name commits like we name commits.

Just for the sake of easy readability we like to name commits and Pull requests in "imperetive present tense." This means the name should start with a verb describing what you are doing (in present tense). All the titles in this document are in imperitive present tense :smile:

Example: `Add parameters to routes` instead of `Added parameters to routes` or `Adding parameters to routes`. 

## Write tests.

We use [Orchestra Testbench](http://orchestraplatform.com/docs/latest/components/testbench/) as our base Phpunit TestCase for testing PHP and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) for testing our JavaScript.

If you need any help with this please don't hesitate to ask.
